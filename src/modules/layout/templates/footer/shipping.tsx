          <p>
            Once our system processes your order, your products are inspected
            thoroughly to ensure they are in a perfect condition.
            <br /> After they pass through the final round of quality check,
            they are packed and handed over to our trusted delivery partner.
            <br /> Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the
            earliest possiblity. In case, they are unable to reach your provided
            address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the
            issue.

            Please refer the product page for estimated shipping and delivery

            arrive in multiple shipments. The estimated delivery times are
            indicative, and, on some occasions, there might be some unavoidable
